# Hello World

This application demonstrates simple name registration using the Eris Decerver
and IPFS.  No blockchains nor smart contracts are employed (yet).

Requirements:

* Docker
* Docker Compose

Begin by running the `test.sh` script to make sure everything's working.

For rapid development you may want to use the `develop.sh` script.

The application communicates with the Decerver using the IPFS protocol.  It is expected that this will be replaced with an Eris protocol in the future.
